/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Secure Talk application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data (contacts) and shared access model for chats and messages.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /chats/{chatId}: Stores chat metadata, accessible to chat participants.
 * - /chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}: Stores individual messages within a chat, accessible to chat participants.
 * - /users/{userId}/contacts/{contactId}: Stores user contacts, accessible only to the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Users can only manage contacts associated with their own user ID.
 * - Chat access is controlled via a `participants` array on the chat document.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed for privacy reasons.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}` path includes the `chatId` within each message document to efficiently query messages belonging to a specific chat. This is crucial for secure `list` operations and avoids needing to traverse user relationships.
 * - The `users/{userId}/contacts/{contactId}` path includes the `userId` within the contact document. This enables security rules to directly verify ownership of contacts based on the `userId` field without external lookups.
