/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership and group-based access model.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles. Only the authenticated user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /chats/{chatId}: Stores metadata for 1-on-1 chats. Access is restricted to participants of the chat.
 * - /chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}: Stores messages within a 1-on-1 chat. Access is restricted to participants of the chat.
 * - /users/{userId}/contacts/{contactId}: Stores a user's contacts. Only the owning user can manage their contacts.
 * - /groups/{groupId}: Stores group chat information.  Access is restricted to group members.
 * - /groups/{groupId}/messages/{messageId}: Stores messages within a group chat. Access is restricted to group members.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - All write operations require authentication.
 * - Data validation is minimal to allow for rapid prototyping.  Only authorization-critical fields are validated.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `participants` map on `chats/{chatId}` and `groups/{groupId}` is used to efficiently determine read/write access for chat participants.
