 * 🔒 Secure Talk – Firestore Rules (Level 1: Full Access for Testing)
 *
 * ✅ Purpose:
 *   These rules are designed for local development and prototype testing only.
 *   All authenticated users can read and write any data in the Firestore database.
 *
 * ⚠️ Warning:
 *   Do NOT use this ruleset in production — it exposes all data to any signed-in user.
 *   Once testing is complete, replace it with principle-based rules (like your previous version).
